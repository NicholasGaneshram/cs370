The user once presented with the home-page can Create, Read, Update existing reminders,or Delete them from their list. Users are greeted with a homepage, giving them the ability to create a reminder, upon clicking on the toggle button it will give them text-boxes specifying the name of the reminder, toggle switches based on the type of reminder, specifications for dates,location, whether they want this reminder to be repeated daily, weekly, monthly or once. Etc. Once the reminder is created, users are returned back to the homepage where they have the option to edit the reminder, delete the reminder or update the reminder to the status of being completed.   
The exit criteria is the user successfully completing their CRUD operations as needed. Once the user has completed their desired inputs they can exit the app, via closing it or logging out.
